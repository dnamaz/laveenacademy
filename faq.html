        <h2>Can you tell me more about Laveen Academy?</h2>
        <p>Laveen Academy is in the initial planning and development phase of setting up the academy club play. It is a collaboration effort between Laveen Soccer and Laveen FC to provide a program to allow our Laveen youth to step up and prepare them as
          a soccer play to play club level soccer in the years ahead. Laveen Academy will bridge the gap between recreational league and competitive league play. It is a low cost alternative to the other academy programs available and it is local to Laveen.</p>

        <h2>When does registration open?</h2>
        <p>There is limited space at the moment while we begin to develop this program. We are accepting the first 10 players per age group. If you are interested, please send the following information in an email to registration@laveenacademy.com. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents first and last name</li>
          <li>Email address </li>
          <li>Player name</li>
          <li>Player age as of August 1st, 2015</li>
          <li>Player birth date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There will be formal registration forms that will need to be returned during the first week of practice.</p>

        <h2>What are the age groups?</h2>
        <p>We are not sure how many people are interested in joining this start up. Initially, we are looking for interested groups from U8, U10 and U12.</p>

        <h2>Where do you practice?</h2>
        <p>We practice at either Manzanita Park or Cesar Chavez park. This all depends on field availability week by week. We have put in field allocations and have only been able to secure half our requested fields.</p>

        <h2>How many times a week will there be practice?</h2>
        <p>Laveen Academy will practice along side Laveen FC twice a week on Monday and Thursday and sometimes Saturday.</p>

        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>The cost per player is $150.00 for an eight month season starting September 1st, 2015.</p>

        <h2>Will there be games?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there will be games played on weekends. Each academy team will be entered to play Laveen Soccer in the fall and spring leagues. Depending on players development, the team will either play up a division or would play with fewer players to
          balance the teams. Our first season will be played as is. This is so that we continue to support Laveen Soccer and provide playing opportunity for academy. Along with playing in the Laveen Soccer league, there will be games played against other
          academy teams and possibly tournaments.</p>

        <h2>Is there an additional cost playing in Laveen Soccer?</h2>
        <p>No, the academy fee paid at the beginning of the season will cover the cost of the fall and spring season. You will not receive a shirt or trophy from Laveen Soccer. We will participate in the pizza eating competition that happens at the end of
          the season.</p>

        <h2>How are you affiliated with Laveen Soccer?</h2>
        <p>Laveen Academy understands that at the root of our soccer program is the families and players that have participated in this league for many years. Steve and Jeff fully support our efforts to provide more playing time for our youth soccer players
          who are looking for something a little extra but want to stay local.</p>

        <h2>Are your coaches licensed?</h2>
        <p>Each of our coaches will carry at a minimum the youth 'F' national license to coach your son/daughter in the youth academy program.</p>

        <h2>Is there a uniform and how much does that cost?</h2>
        <p>Each player will receive 1 academy shirt/shorts and socks. The cost of the uniform will be included in the cost of the academy fees.</p>

        <h2>Is there a website for Laveen Academy?</h2>
        <p>Well, there's a domain. We are working on creating a full website to allow parents and players to review all of our documentation and to stay current with Laveen Academy news.</p>

        <h2>When does Laveen Academy start and when does it end?</h2>
        <p>The Laveen Academy program begins September 1st, 2015 and runs until April 30th, 2016.</p>
