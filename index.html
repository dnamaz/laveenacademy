      <p>Greetings and thank you all for showing interest in Laveen Academy!</p>
      <p>My name is Alek Mitrevski. I am the head coach for Laveen FC 02 Boys and Laveen FC 03 Boys. I started Laveen FC in the summer of 2014 to provide an affordable and competitive youth soccer program to our local youths in Laveen. I have been involved
        with soccer for over 30 years and have been coaching for the past few years. Soccer is a passion of mine which I hope to convey to my teams and community. I currently hold a National E license and I am working on completing my National D license.</p>
      <p>Laveen Academy started as a desire to provide a step up program for our youth soccer players in Laveen. Our current options are limited here locally, so parents and players need to travel to neighboring communities to participate in more comprehensive
        programs. Laveen Academy will not be able to compete with these larger and established organizations. Our focus , instead, is to organize a small group of coaches dedicated to improving the game of soccer for our youth players.</p>
      <p>This is the first year for Laveen Academy and will determine how we move forward for the years to come. We are excited to start this Academy and hope you are as well.</p>
      <p>Below, you will find a link to an FAQ page that I have setup to answer questions. If you have any additional questions please send an email to questions at laveenacademy.com.</p>
      <p>Registration is now open. To register, please send an email to registration@laveenacademy.com with your intent to participate in the 2015-2016 academy year. Please provide the following:</p>
